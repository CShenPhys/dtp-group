All members of the A&I group, along with visitors, and sentient beings in general, are expected to act in concordance with the following code of conduct. We will enforce this code as necessary. We expect active cooperation from all members to help ensure a safe and collaborative environment for everybody.

## The Quick Version
[*No member of the community should take unfair advantage of any other member of the community.*](http://www.admissions.caltech.edu/content/honor-code)

How does this apply here?

Complementing its dedication to open collaboration, trust, and development, the A&I group is committed to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of group members in any form. Sexual language and imagery are universally unacceptable for any group venue, including group meetings, presentations, or discussions.

## The Less Quick Version
Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Members or visitors asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact [JJ Carrasco](mailto:john-joseph.carrasco@ipht.fr) immediately.Note: All faculty, postdocs, and staff at Northwestern University are *Manditory Reporters* -- they must contact the Office of Equity if they learn about any harrasment.  If for whatever reasons you would not feel comfortable coming to JJ,  [Juna Kollmeier](https://carnegiescience.edu/scientist/juna-kollmeir) (jak at cita.utoronto.ca ), has volunteered to be a safe informal point of contact;  she works for neither JJ nor Northwestern, and has agreed to help mediate if ever necessary. For official concerns involving harrasment, group members must see the office of equity of either Northwestern University. If you do not know whether something constitutes harrasment there is an Ombudsperson for Northwestern you can contact: [Office of Ombudsperson](https://www.northwestern.edu/ombuds/index.html) which is confidential and not a manditory reporter.  


More broadly -- the entire spirit of the Amplitudes and Insight group is to instantiate a healthy and conductive work environment.  Anything hostile to that work environment is not ok -- absolutely feel free to insist of being free of workplace hostility in any form.  The group as a whole is commited to this as has the Department of Physics and Astronomy. Please see the community standards ascribed to by the [Department of Physics and Astronomy](https://physics.northwestern.edu/equity-and-inclusion/community-standards.html).


We expect members to follow these guidelines at any group-related event.
