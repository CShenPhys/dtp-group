## Computers are great. Ideas are better.

The Amplitudes and Insights effort likes to push the line of *failure-point predictions*.  These involve calculations that take modern methods and world-class technologies to their breaking-point.  To make progress, by definition, this strategy invites new ideas, new physical stories, and ultimately the apprehension of novel structure.

The goal is deep physical insight, with a joy in developing and leveraging --- for mutual benefit --- domain expertise in scattering amplitudes, relativity, quantum field theory, string theory, and cosmology.

Like players of [*advanced chess*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Chess), group members are encouraged to invoke algorithms and automation to aid in tactically navigating the diverging tree of candidate moves.

The group is located along the lake just north of Chicago in the [Department of Physics and Astronomy](https://www.physics.northwestern.edu) of the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences of [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu). 

The group is run by [Prof. John Joseph M. Carrasco](http://prettyquestions.com). You can find most of the group's publications [here](/publications/). You can learn more about individual group members [here](/members/).

Any open postdoctoral positions are posted on [amplitudes.org](http://amplitudes.org/jobs/).

For people who are interested in joining the group as a new Ph.D. student, please go to our [departmental website](https://physics.northwestern.edu/graduate/doctoral-program/admissions/index.html) and follow the instructions to apply. It makes sense to mention Professor Carrasco in the Statement of Purpose that you submit as part of your application materials.

The group was initially funded in part by the [European Union's Horizon 2020 Framework Program](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/) via the 2014-ERC-stg: [Strategic Predictions for Quantum Field Theories (preQFT)](/funding/). Since 2020 the group has been funded through the [Alfred P. Sloan Foundation](https://sloan.org/fellowships/), the [United States Department of Energy](https://science.osti.gov), an endowment by the AT & T Corporation, and the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences, Northwestern University.
