# "Towards Cosmological Observables I"
### A local workship, Friday 28 April, Northwestern University

## Theme

Recent progress in the cosmological bootstrap have demonstrated that amplitudes themes and ideas might fruitfully engage  with inflationary physics. The workshop series brings together experts from cosmology and scattering amplitudes to develop these novel connections.

This first workshop in the series is primarily pedagogic: to teach us flat-space momentum focused amplitudes folks how to think about flat-space correlators and extensions to dS.
